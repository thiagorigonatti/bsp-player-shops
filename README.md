## RESCUED Fork of BSP-PlayerShops

**Note:**

This is a **fork, RESCUED**, of BSP-PlayerShops. The main purpose of this fork was to:

- Convert the build system from Maven to Gradle

Some minor fixes were applied to make it work with Minecraft 1.21, which is the target API version.  
Due to limited time, further fixes will be applied as needed on my own server**.

**Important Warnings:**

- Some integrations may be outdated or non-functional.
- There is a potential risk of undesired or even irreversible behavior when using certain features.

**Usage on my server:**

- The plugin works well as an addon for BossShopPro-0.0.1-RESCUED.

> Use this fork with caution and always make backups before testing additional integrations.
